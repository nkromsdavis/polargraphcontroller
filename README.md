====================

Polargraph controller
Copyright Sandy Noble 2014.

- Requires v0.5.4 of the excellent ControlP5 GUI library available from http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/ 
  - (http://code.google.com/p/controlp5/downloads/detail?name=controlP5_0.5.4.zip&can=2&q=).
- Requires the excellent Geomerative library available from http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/.
- Currently only runs on Processing v1.5

This is a desktop application for controlling a polargraph machine, communicating using ASCII command language over a serial link.

Very sorry that this doesn't work with newest versions of the libraries and Processing.

The [latest releases bundle] (https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/releases/latest) contains 
copies of all the libraries that I use, as well as all the source, and compiled versions of the code where sensible.
